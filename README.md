# Springboard Capstone Project for Machine Learning Engineering

This repository documents my Springboard Machine Learning Engineer capstone project.  This 
project involved the full lifecycle of data collection, analysis, wrangling, and modeling. 
The project adapts a Bert-based model to be used for classification of text from 
dozens of publicans.  It was built using both AWS and Google Cloud.

For an explanation of the capstone project, click [here]("./CAPSTONE.md"). 

* [data-collection](https://github.com/metacreek/springboard/tree/master/data-collection) contains code used to crawl dozens of news and opinion websites.

* [data-wrangling](https://github.com/metacreek/springboard/tree/master/data-wrangling) contains Jupyter notebooks outlining evaluation of the collected data and analysis use to wrangle the data into a usable format.

* [modeling](https://github.com/metacreek/springboard/tree/master/modeling) contains code and notebooks used to fine tune a BERT model to classify news stories.

* [api](https://github.com/metacreek/springboard/tree/master/api) contains code used to host an API based on my model.

* [mini-projects](https://github.com/metacreek/springboard/tree/master/mini-projects) contains Jupyter notebooks submitted as part of classwork for the Springboard Machine Learning Engineer Bootcamp.  This code is not directly related to the capstone project.
